# EDA-on-US_accident-2016-2021_dataset
In this repository I have done EDA on US accident dataset from kaggle.
# About Dataset
- It contains accident report from 2016-2021.
- Contains around 20lakhs rows and 47 columns.
- It contains features like 'Severity', 'Start_Time', 'End_Time', 'Start_Lat', 'Start_Lng','End_Lat', 'End_Lng', 'Distance(mi)', 'Description', 'Number', 'Street','Side', 'City', 'County', 'State', etc.
# Few conclusions:-
- CANADA ranks 1 in highest accident state in USA. And it is also the most populous state in USA.
- Miami is a city in florida that has highest accident count and Florida is a 3rd most populus state in USA. That could be a reasonable reason why miami has highest no of accidents.
- But according to me population is not the reason as los angles has highest population but it is second place in cities by accident and it's accident's rate is 40,000 less than miami.
- In this EDA, I have tried to find out the reasons for high accident rate.
